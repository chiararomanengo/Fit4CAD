# Fit4CAD: A point cloud benchmark for fitting simple geometric primitives in CAD models

Code for the 3D Object Retrieval (3DOR) 2021 paper [1], currently in press.

* The folder "dataset" contains 225 high quality point clouds, each of which was obtained by sampling a CAD object. The dataset is already split into a  training set and a test set.

* The folder "MATLAB" contains the codes and input files used to generate the results presented in [1].

For further details on the benchmark (e.g., the file format, the quality indicators and the accuracy measures), the user is referred to [1].
