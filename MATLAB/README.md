# Fit4CAD: A point cloud benchmark for fitting simple geometric primitives in CAD models

## MATLAB files for the evaluation of the methods in [1]

### TABLE 2
Values provided in Table 2 are obtained by the script "main_ClassificationMeasures.m". One needs to set the following parameters:
* model_number: it identifies one of the 35 point clouds from the test set (integer from 1 to 35).
* method: one of the two methods considered in the benchmark (either "PG" or "HT"); 
Optionally, one can check the classification measures for any patch by setting details to 1 (default value is 0).
